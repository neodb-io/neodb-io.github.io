### 1. About the Paper
- [http://cidrdb.org/cidr2020/papers/p29-neumann-cidr20.pdf](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2020/papers/p29-neumann-cidr20.pdf)
- The first author <i>Thomas Neumann</i> is a famous database researcher who founded HyPer system which was acquired by tableau


### 2. WHY
- DRAM is relatively expensive than NVMe SSD (20~40 times)
- Latest NVMe SSD can archieve 3.5GB/s sequential read per disk
  - The paper didn't mention latency, but AFAIK, modern NVMe SSD (SLC) can achieve about 30us 4K read/write latency.
- NVMe SSD has much better capacity than before
  - 100 TB per server is not unusual anymore

### 3. Main Ideas
- Use a carefully designed <b>buffer manager</b> that combines low-overhead buffering with variable-size pages.
- A fixed-size page would make the buffer manager easier to build but also makes users harder to use.
- This paper is mainly talking about the buffer manager

### 4. Key Concepts
#### 4.1. Buffer Manager
- Database pages are organized in <i>size classes</i> and 64KB is the smallest page size.
- Thus all pages will be located directly into proper page fragments.
- Buffer manger uses seperate mmap for each <i>size classes</i>
- Open Channel for better storage control is mentioned but not yet implemented

#### 4.2. Pointer Swizzling
- Pointers are encoded to indentify whether target pages are loaded into memory or still on-disk.
- If target page is on disk, then it will use 6 bits of the pointer to identify its <i>size class</i>.

#### 4.3. Versioned Latches
- Each active buffer frame contains a <b>versioned latch</b> which can either be acquired in <i>exclusive mode, shared mode, or optimistic mode</i>
- a versioned latch is a single 64-bit integer, of which 5 bits are used to store state information, while the remaining 59 bits are used to store a version counter

#### 4.4. Index & Data Store
- Buffer manager uses B+ tree as its index and a 8 bytes identifier as B+ tree's key
- The identifier is generated during insertion and will increase strictly monotonically
  - <i>But I didn't see further detail about how identifiers are generated...</i>


### 5. Conclusion & Comments
- This paper provides a concept of how to utilize the power of NVMe SSD
- The main idea is a buffer manager but it didn't show more details about how the system works, especially how its index works.

### 6. What We've Leared
- Not very much, most of the ideas were already used in different products
